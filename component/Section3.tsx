                        <p>In a utopian marketplace, the best option would be to move a bunch of footwear/apparel or else, in bulk (one shot), to: another reseller, store or wholesaler somewhere on planet earth.

                            Well, there are no B2B marketplaces anywhere that deal with: limited/ hyped goods, or a marketplace where stores (with no brand account) & reseller could buy from (in bulk prices footwear, apparel, accessories) without any boundaries or questions! So let's try and create that platform: so other store owners & resellers/wholesalers worldwide could profit from!</p>

                        <p>Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do they do? They flip them on well known resell platform/marketplace; and we are all very familiar with these marketplaces... . How can you sell some Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are offering a price of 20-35% under retail? Simple, if you are not the store yourself or a person who bought them at roughly 35% to 40% off retail... then forget it!</p>
                        <h5>So, as a store owner, we see 3 options :</h5>
                        <p>Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one etc. (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so itâ€™s a loss).Shipping will take a while, and you are wasting time & labor...</p>

                            <p> 3.Last but not least : Sell them on a platform in bulk anonymously, with or without a discount ! Allowing your Hyped or general merchandise release inventory to reach multiple stores/resellers in the USA and worldwide . Forget the classic individual B2C (business to consumer) model and , aim at other stores/ wholesalers .The Hype around the footwear, Apparel, Accessory resell market is wide and active! There are many options out there that need to be exploited!</p>
