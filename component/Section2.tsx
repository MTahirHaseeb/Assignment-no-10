                        <p>The idea of building a B2B marketplace, came to us a few years ago. Experiencing the process of buying and selling in bulk: footwear, apparel etc... since early 2002 weâ€™ve encountered issues and restrictions , we also faced lots of question from sellers and buyers, shipping issues etc... But at the end of this journey, we are now providing answers and solutions that will help our network and partners!</p>
